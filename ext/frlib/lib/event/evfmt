does use the lisa format:
starts with liev and ends on leev
the following blocks does exist:
en - event name
tn - target name
the following list does exist:
ep - event parameter
tp - target parameters
at - attributes

the attribute list is a list of lists of type:
as - single attribute
the single attribute is a list of two blocks:
vn - variable name
and one of the value blocks

the parameter lists are lists of value blocks
the order define the order of the arguments

the following value blocks are defined:
vs - string value: utf8 encoded nul-terminated string
vi - 64bit signed integer (big endian)
vf - 64bit float value (big endian)
vv - void - empty (especially for arguments)


the resulting frame can be send in binary or base64 encoded 
(currently only the latter form is supported)

in either case it is prefixed with a $ sign and an optional space.
if the data do start with 'l' it is in binary form if it starts
with a 'b' it is base64 encoded and needs to be decoded before
parsing.
